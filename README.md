  **INSIGHT: A Universal Neural Simulator Framework for Analog Circuits with Autoregressive Transformers**


**Step 1:** Collect Train, Validation and Test Data for a given circuit on a given technology node

**Step 2:** Perform Metric Sequencing : Generates "metric_sequencing.txt". Metric sequencing codes to be open-sourced shortly.

**Step 3:** **Train INSIGHT:** Architecture and Pre-training Source Code provided in "INSIGHT_Pretraining.py"

**Step 4:** Perform LoRA-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning wherever knowledge transfer is desired


If you plan to use any of these codes, please cite our DAC'25 paper:
